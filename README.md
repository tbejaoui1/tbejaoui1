- 👋 Hi, I’m @tbejaoui1
- 👀 I’m interested in AI and Controls System Design.
- 🌱 I have finished my Masters' theses, : where the 1st was on using LSTM for optimizing spacecraft's orbital dynamics via solar potential fields during a flyby and the second was about optimizing GPS tracking via Kalman Filtering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that require NN modeling in a variety of fields including the social sciences sector.
